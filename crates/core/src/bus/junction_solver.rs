//! Junction solver: region-growth outer loop + strategy framework.
//!
//! The caller hands us a crossing tile and the set of specs that cross
//! at that tile (usually two, from `classify_crossing`). We build a
//! `GrowingRegion` around the crossing, then iterate: try each
//! registered `JunctionStrategy` on the current region, and if none
//! succeed, walk each participating spec's path one step outward and
//! try again. The loop terminates on success, on a tile-count cap, or
//! when every frontier is exhausted.
//!
//! `GrowingRegion` tracks two things per spec:
//! - a **frontier** `(start_idx, end_idx)` into the spec's routed path,
//!   representing the range of path tiles currently in the region,
//! - and a cached tile set so "is this tile in the region?" is O(1).
//!
//! Each iteration of `grow()` advances both ends of each frontier by
//! one step. The bbox is the tight enclosing rectangle of the accumulated
//! tile set. Tiles inside the bbox that belong to non-participating
//! specs' paths are marked forbidden — strategies must avoid them. If
//! a future strategy wants to also rewrite one of those specs, it can
//! be promoted to participating in a later pass (not yet implemented —
//! single-pass for the scaffold).
//!
//! Strategies consume a `Junction` snapshot (the existing
//! `bus::junction::Junction` type, which is already documented and is
//! the long-term template input). `GrowingRegion::to_junction` builds
//! the snapshot on each strategy call. Strategies also receive the
//! initial crossing tile, the current growth iteration, and references
//! to `routed_paths` + `hard_obstacles` in a context struct so new
//! fields can be added without breaking every impl.
//!
//! This module intentionally knows nothing about `BeltSpec` or any
//! ghost-router internals — strategies live in `ghost_router.rs` where
//! those types are in scope and can drive the existing templates.
