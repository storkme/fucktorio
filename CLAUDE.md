# Fucktorio

Automated Factorio factory blueprint generator. Takes a target item + production rate, solves recipe dependencies, generates a spatial layout, and exports a Factorio-importable blueprint string.

## Quick start

```bash
# Requires: uv (manages Python version + deps)
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/

# Generate a blueprint
uv run python -m src.pipeline
```

### Rust workspace

Rust code lives in a Cargo workspace under `crates/`:

- `crates/core/` — pure shared logic (models, solver, recipe DB, blueprint export, A*, bus layout, validation). The `wasm` feature gates `tsify-next`/`wasm-bindgen` derives so `core` can be used from both PyO3 and WASM.
- `crates/pyo3-bindings/` — thin PyO3 adapter exposing `astar_path` + `negotiate_lanes` to Python (compiled into `fucktorio_native.so` via maturin; manifest pinned in root `pyproject.toml`).
- `crates/wasm-bindings/` — wasm-bindgen wrapper exposing `solve`, `layout`, `export_blueprint`, and recipe lookups to the browser.

Build commands:

```bash
# Rust workspace check
cargo check

# Python extension (A* for the Python pipeline)
uv run maturin develop --manifest-path crates/pyo3-bindings/Cargo.toml
# Editable installs don't always refresh target/.so — may need a manual copy (see agent memory: feedback_maturin.md)

# WASM bundle for the web app (outputs into web/src/wasm-pkg)
wasm-pack build crates/wasm-bindings --target web --out-dir ../../web/src/wasm-pkg
```

### Web app (`web/`)

Interactive browser UI that runs the full solver → bus layout → blueprint export pipeline client-side via WASM. Stack: Vite + vanilla TypeScript + PixiJS v8 + pixi-viewport.

```bash
cd web
npm install        # or pnpm / bun
npm run dev        # Vite dev server
npm run build      # tsc --noEmit && vite build
```

WASM is loaded by `web/src/engine.ts`, which wraps the generated `fucktorio_wasm` module. See `docs/web-app-plan.md` for context.

## Development conventions

- **Python version**: Pinned in `.python-version`. Use `uv` to manage the venv and run commands.
- **Running snippets**: Don't use inline `python -c` for multi-line exploratory code. Instead, write a script to `scripts/` (e.g. `scripts/debug_lanes.py`) and run it with `uv run python scripts/debug_lanes.py`. This makes it easier to iterate and review.
- **Running tests**: `uv run pytest tests/`.

## Architecture

Two parallel implementations share the same pipeline shape:

**Python pipeline** (`src/pipeline.py` orchestrates) — the canonical/reference implementation; used for pytest, HTML visualizations, and analysis tooling.

**Rust pipeline** (`crates/core/`) — complete port of all pipeline stages (solver, recipe DB, bus layout, blueprint export, validation, A*), used by the PyO3 extension and by the WASM web app.

Pipeline stages:

1. **Solver** (`src/solver/`, `crates/core/src/solver.rs`) — Recursively resolves recipes, calculates machine counts and flow rates. Returns `SolverResult`. Python uses `draftsman.data`; Rust loads a pre-extracted `crates/core/data/recipes.json`.
2. **Layout** — Two engines, both return `LayoutResult`:
   - **Bus** (`src/bus/`, `crates/core/src/bus/`) — Deterministic row-based layout with main bus pattern. The primary focus, and the engine exposed to the web app.
   - **Spaghetti** (`src/spaghetti/`, `src/routing/`, `src/search/`) — Python-only. Random search with A* place-and-route. Parked pending routing rework ([#62](https://github.com/storkme/fucktorio/issues/62)).
3. **Blueprint** (`src/blueprint/`, `crates/core/src/blueprint.rs`) — Converts `LayoutResult` to a base64 blueprint string. Python version wraps draftsman; Rust version emits the JSON + zlib + base64 envelope directly.
4. **Validation** (`src/validate.py`, `crates/core/src/validate/`) — 21 functional checks: pipe isolation, fluid port connectivity, inserter chains, power coverage, belt flow/structural, underground belt pairs, lane throughput.
5. **Analysis** (`src/analysis/`) — Python-only. Parses real Factorio blueprints into production graphs for studying community layouts.

## Key models (`src/models.py`)

- `ItemFlow` — item name, rate, fluid flag
- `MachineSpec` — machine type, recipe, count, inputs/outputs
- `SolverResult` — machines, external inputs/outputs, dependency order
- `PlacedEntity` — entity name, position, direction, recipe, carries (what item/fluid it transports)
- `LayoutResult` — entities, connections, dimensions

## Factorio game rules (constraints for the layout engine)

These are the physical rules the layout engine must satisfy:

- **Machines** craft recipes, need ingredients delivered and products extracted
- **Inserters** pick from one side, drop to the other. Regular inserters reach 1 tile; long-handed inserters reach 2 tiles
- **Belts** move items in a direction, connect when adjacent. Different tiers have different throughput limits (yellow: 15/s, red: 30/s, blue: 45/s)
- **Pipes** carry fluids, connect to any adjacent pipe (and merge — separate fluid networks must be physically isolated)
- **Fluid ports** on machines are at specific tile positions (queryable from `draftsman.data.entities`)
- **Fluid-box mirroring (Space Age)** — entities with fluid boxes (oil-refinery, chemical-plant, etc.) support a `mirror: true` blueprint attribute that flips fluid port positions along the entity's primary axis. Combined with `direction`, this gives 8 orientations (4 rotations × 2 mirrors). For oil-refinery, `mirror=True` flips inputs-south/outputs-north into inputs-north/outputs-south, letting us reuse the chemical-plant header-above-machine layout pattern. Exposed via `entity.mirror` in draftsman 3.3+. Only effective in Factorio Space Age (2.0+); ignored in 1.1.
- **Entities** cannot overlap
- **Belt lane mechanics** — see `docs/belt-mechanics.md` for detailed lane-level physics (sideloading, underground belt lane rules, splitter behavior)
- **Power** — machines need electricity; medium-electric-pole covers a 7x7 area

## Recipe complexity ladder

Tracks which recipes produce zero-error blueprints. Each tier represents increasing complexity. Moving up = real progress.

| Tier | Recipe | Complexity | Spaghetti | Bus |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | `iron-gear-wheel` | 1 recipe, 1 solid input | Inconsistent (xfail) — loops, contamination, unpaired UG | SOLVED |
| 2 | `electronic-circuit` | 2 recipes, 2 solid inputs | Failing — belt-flow-reachability | SOLVED (incl. from ores) |
| 3 | `plastic-bar` | 1 recipe, 1 fluid + 1 solid input | Failing — pipe isolation | SOLVED |
| 4 | `advanced-circuit` | 5+ recipes, mixed solid/fluid | Failing — massive routing failures | Partial (from plates: lane-throughput warnings, needs [#65](https://github.com/storkme/fucktorio/issues/65)) |
| 5 | `processing-unit` | Deep chain, multiple fluids | Not attempted | Not attempted |
| 6 | `rocket-control-unit` | Very deep chain | Not attempted | Not attempted |

### Known failure modes

1. **Belt-flow-reachability** (current #1 blocker): Continuation routing connects tiles topologically but belt directions point the wrong way for input edges. The belt path exists physically but items can't flow upstream. Fix needed at `route_connections` level.
2. **Belt cross-item contamination**: SOLVED for tier 1 via `other_item_tiles` hard-blocking in A*. Proximity penalty (+3.0) and contamination guard in `_fix_belt_directions()` prevent residual cases.
3. **Belt loops**: A* routing accidentally creates cycles in the belt network.
4. **Disconnected networks**: Output belts from different machines don't merge into a connected trunk.
5. **Throughput violations**: Too many inserters feeding the same belt lane.
6. **Failed routing edges**: A* can't find any path from source to destination.
7. **Pipe merge contamination**: Adjacent pipes carrying different fluids merge (fluids connect to all adjacent pipes).

## Layout engine

The layout pipeline: **place machine → assign inserters → route edges → repeat for next machine → place poles**.

### Incremental place-and-route (`src/routing/orchestrate.py`)

`build_layout_incremental()` places machines one at a time in dependency order. For each machine:
1. Try candidate positions (starting at spacing=2, corridor penalty rewards gap=1 for connected machines)
2. Assign inserters — `_get_sides()` returns all 12 border positions for 3x3 machines, shuffled by RNG
3. Route edges immediately — if routing fails, try the next candidate position
4. Adjacent machines (gap=1) get direct inserters via `_find_direct_gap()`, skipping belt routing entirely

External edges use belt stubs + A* continuation routing instead of boundary conventions. `route_connections()` supports incremental calls via `existing_belt_dir_map`, `existing_group_networks`, `io_y_slots` parameters.

### Parallel random search (`src/search/layout_search.py`)

Single-pass evaluation of 60 random candidates in parallel (evolution was tried and abandoned -- random search produces same quality, 5x faster). Three gene dimensions:
- **Placement order** — which machine to place first
- **Position seed** — RNG seed for candidate position shuffling
- **Side preferences** — inserter side priority per machine

`search_with_retries()` wraps this with up to 5 independent searches, returning the first zero-error layout or the best found. `SearchStats` dataclass logs per-attempt scores. Candidates scored by validation errors + failed edges + belt count + area - direct insertions.

### Shared infrastructure (`src/routing/`)

- **Production graph** (`graph.py`): Converts `SolverResult` into a directed graph of `MachineNode`s connected by `FlowEdge`s
- **A* router** (`router.py`): Item-aware lane-aware grid pathfinding — state is `(x, y, forced, lane)`. `other_item_tiles` parameter hard-blocks cross-item belt contamination; proximity penalty (+3.0) near foreign networks. Tracks belt lanes (left/right) through turns and sideloads. Underground belt support with perpendicular entry penalty. `_fix_belt_directions()` includes contamination guard. Enhanced retry loop (5 retries) with incoming contamination checks
- **Inserter assignment** (`inserters.py`): Lane-aware inserter placement. `InserterAssignment` includes `approach_vec`, `target_lane`, `is_direct` fields
- **Common utilities** (`common.py`): Machine sizes, belt tier selection, direction constants, lane constants (`LANE_LEFT`/`LANE_RIGHT`), `inserter_target_lane()`
- **Routing result** (`router.py`): `RoutingResult` exposes `belt_dir_map` and `group_networks` for incremental routing

### The primary remaining problem (spaghetti)

Independent edge routing: `route_connections()` routes each A* edge independently, so earlier edges claim tiles that force later edges into bad paths (loops, wrong directions, contamination). This is the fundamental blocker — see [#62](https://github.com/storkme/fucktorio/issues/62) for the proposed fix (negotiated congestion routing). Spaghetti work is parked while bus layout is the focus.

## Bus layout engine (`src/bus/`)

Deterministic row-based layout using the main bus pattern. Machines grouped by recipe into rows, items transported on parallel trunk belts, with underground sideloading for branches.

### How it works

1. **Solver** produces `SolverResult` (same as spaghetti)
2. **Placer** (`placer.py`) groups machines by recipe into rows, splits rows when throughput exceeds belt capacity (lane-splitting for both lanes of a belt)
3. **Templates** (`templates.py`) stamp out belt/inserter patterns for each row type (single-input, dual-input, with optional lane splitting via sideload bridges)
4. **Bus router** (`bus_router.py`) places trunk belts, routes branches from trunks to rows via underground belt pairs
5. **Validation** runs the same checks as spaghetti (`validate.py`)

### Current status

Bus passes tiers 1-3 with zero validation errors (iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit incl. from ores, plastic-bar). Tier 4 (advanced-circuit from plates) has lane-throughput warnings from single-lane sideload bottleneck ([#64](https://github.com/storkme/fucktorio/issues/64)). Tier 4 via ores is blocked by [#68](https://github.com/storkme/fucktorio/issues/68) (fluid rows can't fit 2+ solid inputs in 3-tile pitch).

### Bus routing details

- **Lane spacing**: 1-tile (trunks on adjacent columns, no gaps)
- **N-to-M balancer families** (`bus_router.LaneFamily`): when an item has `N_producers != N_lanes`, the planner creates a balancer family and stamps a pre-generated template from `src/bus/balancer_library.py` (SAT-generated via Factorio-SAT, see `scripts/generate_balancer_library.py`). Covers 1→M, N→M asymmetric shapes. Producer WEST belts are wired to template input tiles via explicit path rendering (topmost producer → leftmost input tile to avoid crossings). Balancer footprint + feeder paths are registered as A\* obstacles so tap-offs route around them.
- **Row reflow for tall templates**: families whose template height exceeds the default 2-tile recipe gap trigger `extra_gap_after_row` reservations in the two-pass `place_rows` call. Formula: `max(0, H-3)` for N=1 families (balancer overlaps producer output row), `max(0, H-2)` for N≥2 (balancer sits below producer rows).
- **Contiguous family lanes**: `_optimize_lane_order` rejects permutations that split a family's lanes non-contiguously — templates stamp at fixed width and require adjacent output columns.
- **Even row splitting**: Producer rows are evenly sized for balanced throughput per lane
- **Tap-off underground crossings**: Tap-offs go EAST on the surface; first tile is always a surface belt (turn point from trunk) to avoid sideloading onto UG inputs. Underground hops cross other trunks with short spans.
- **Output returns (N→1 only, hand-rolled)**: the single remaining hand-rolled balancer path is the N→1 Z-wrap (`_route_intermediate_lane` `balance_y` code) — triggered when 2+ producers feed a single lane. Not yet migrated to template framework because N→1 templates have output-not-at-edge, requiring column reservation.
- **Output mergers**: Final product rows use EAST-flowing output belts, merging at the bottom-right of the layout via a SOUTH splitter chain.
- **Negotiated crossing map**: Rust `negotiate_lanes()` pre-computes crossings between all lane segments (including mergers), augmenting `_blocked_xs_at` so tap-offs know about future entity positions
- **Fluid lanes**: Pipe trunks + pipe-to-ground tap-offs. Fluid lanes don't block belt tap-offs (pipes and belts don't conflict)

### Factorio belt lane rules

- **Sideloading**: Feeding a belt from the side only fills the NEAR lane (the lane closest to the feeder)
- **Sideloading onto underground input**: Only fills the FAR lane — must feed UG inputs straight (same direction), not from the side
- **Belt turns**: 90-degree turns preserve both lanes (with CW/CCW rotation)
- **Splitters**: Distribute items 50/50 between two output belts, preserving lane assignment per belt

## Verification & validation

- `src/verify.py` — structural blueprint validation (overlap detection, unpaired undergrounds, ASCII map)
- `src/validate.py` — functional validation (21 checks: pipe isolation, fluid connectivity, inserter chains, power coverage, belt flow/structural, underground pairs, lane throughput)
- `crates/core/src/validate/` — Rust mirror of the same check suite, used by the WASM web app
- `tests/` — pytest suite with `--viz` flag for HTML visualizations, deployed to GitHub Pages via CI

## Verification protocol for layout engine changes

Layout changes are easy to get wrong — errors can be masked by other changes, imports can shadow silently, and error counts can drop to zero for the wrong reason. Follow this protocol:

1. **Check the viz**: After any routing/placement change, generate `test_viz/iron-gear-wheel-10s.html` and visually inspect it. Zero validation errors mean nothing if the layout looks wrong.
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_spaghetti.py::TestSpaghettiVisualization::test_viz_iron_gear_wheel --viz -x
   ```
2. **Verify the fix is running**: If you add new logic inside the incremental builder, confirm it actually executes (e.g. add a temporary `logger.info` or check that output changes). The `_evaluate` function catches ALL exceptions silently, so broken code just scores 10000 and gets ignored.
3. **Watch for import shadowing**: `build_layout_incremental()` is a long function. A `from .router import X` anywhere inside it makes `X` a local variable for the ENTIRE function, shadowing any module-level import of `X`. All imports from router should be at the top of the file.
4. **Don't trust error count drops alone**: If errors go from 5 to 0, ask WHY. Check that belt types are correct (should be yellow transport-belt for 10/s), check that the topology makes sense, check that the specific fix you intended is the reason errors dropped.
5. **One search attempt should take <2s** with the Rust A*. If it takes >10s, something is wrong (likely N×A* instead of multi-start, or an infinite loop).
